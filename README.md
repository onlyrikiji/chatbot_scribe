# SCRIBE

A Chatbot for Collecting and Retrieving Information from Multiple PDFs

# Introduction

The SCRIBE Chatbot is a Python program designed for engaging in conversations with multiple PDF documents. Users can inquire about the contents of the PDFs using natural language, and the application will furnish pertinent responses by leveraging a language model. It's important to bear in mind that the app exclusively addresses queries related to the PDFs that have been loaded into the system. This chatbot is useful for enabling efficient information retrieval, offering customized learning support, and serving as a time-saving tool.
